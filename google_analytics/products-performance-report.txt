google analytics product performance report:
    e.g.
    top ten cities for a certain product
    top ten certain products
    top five buys in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales

Never manage to memerise this sort of report so here is a quick note for avoiding muddling next time

Report:

Conversions -> E-Commerce -> Product Performance ->
    set Primary
    -> Add segment -> New Segment -> Location -> 
        Country contain "" 
        OR
        Region contain ""
        ...
        etc

        -> save to add the segment
